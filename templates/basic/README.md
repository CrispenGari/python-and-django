# Basics of Python Django

### 1. Django's template system

> First, create a directory called templates in your basic directory. Django will look for templates in there.
> Within the templates directory you have just created, create another directory called basic, and within that create a file called index.html.

We don't need to worry about how Django will be able to identify the templates that we are going to create because in the `templates/settings.py` file it is configured for us.

###### `templates/settings.py`

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [],
        ....
    },
]
```

> We need to register our application in the `templates/settings.py` under `INSTALLED_APPS` python list by just adding the app name in our case it's `basic` as string as follow:

###### `templates/settings.py`

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
     ...,
    'basic',
    ....
]
```

> Now in the views.py we should now render the template. The View.py will now look as follows:

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader
# Create your views here.

def main(req):
    template = loader.get_template('basic/index.html')
    context = {}
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, req))

```

### 2. Static files

Aside from the HTML generated by the server, web applications generally need to serve additional files — such as images, JavaScript, or CSS — necessary to render the complete web page. In Django, we refer to these files as “static files”.

> First, create a directory called static in your `basic` directory. Django will look for static files there, similarly to how Django finds templates inside `basic/templates/`.
> Within the static directory you have just created, create another directory called basic and within that create a file called style.css. In other words, your stylesheet should be at `basic/static/basic/styles.css`. Because of how the AppDirectoriesFinder static file finder works, you can refer to this static file in Django as `basic/styles.css`, similar to how you reference the path for templates.

> Now go to the `basic/static/basic` and create a JavaScript file as well called `index.js`. Create a button in the `index.html` file and load static files so that your index.html will look as follows:

###### `basic/templates/basic/index.html`

```
{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'basic/styles.css' %}" />

<h1>{{name}}</h1>
<img src="{% static 'basic/avatar.jpg' %}" alt="avatar" id="avatar" />
<br />
<button type="button" id="button">Show Image</button>

<script src="{%static 'basic/index.js'%}"></script>


```

##### `basic/static/basic/styles.css`

```
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen,
    Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
}

```

##### `basic/static/basic/index.js`

```
document.getElementById("button").innerText = "Hide Image";
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function () {
  if (document.getElementById("avatar").style.display === "none") {
    document.getElementById("avatar").style.display = "block";
    document.getElementById("button").innerText = "Hide Image";
  } else {
    document.getElementById("avatar").style.display = "none";
    document.getElementById("button").innerText = "Show Image";
  }
});
```

> Now the styles are applied and if you click the button then you are toggling the image to be shown or hidden on the DOM. It's working
